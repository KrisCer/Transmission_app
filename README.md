<b>TBETA</b> gives you a simple graphical interface that let's you design a two-terminal Graphene nanoribbon (GNR) junction with a 60°, 120° or 180°, angle between the leads. Afterwards calculate it's transport and electronic properties based on nearest-neighbour tight-binding model. Conductance is expressed within Landauer formalism and calculated using Green's function methods.
